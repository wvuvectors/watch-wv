1	Nanotrap concentration of raw influent and quantification by ddPCR
2	Nanotrap concentration of raw influent and quantification by ddPCR; the only modification from major_lab_method 1 is that post-RNA extraction, four equal volumes of RNA extract are combined for ddPCR analysis, rather than being combined pre-concentration.
