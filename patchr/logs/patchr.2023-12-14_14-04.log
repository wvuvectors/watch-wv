Ok, I'm about to start modifying the watchdb files in data/latest/.
First, let's back up data/latest/ to data/latest_bk/.
Now I'll create a new watchdb folder in data/incremental/2023-12-14_14-04/.
It will hold the latest watchdb after update with data from /Users/tpd0001/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-wvuvectors@gmail.com/My Drive/DRISCOLL_LAB/PROJECTS/WaTCH/TESTING_LAB/DATA_PCR.
Now I'm merging the watchdb tables from data/latest/ with the update tables in data/updates/2023-12-14_14-04/.
These merged tables will be put in the folder that I just created, data/incremental/2023-12-14_14-04/.
Since there should be no duplicate IDs after a successful validateUpdate step, I can just use concatenate.
Now I will generate the RESULT table using the updated watchdb tables in data/incremental/2023-12-14_14-04.

WARN : File data/incremental/2023-12-14_14-04/watchdb.result.txt does not exist or can not be read.

4_calculateResults.pl exited with error code 255 and caused patchr to abort.
!!!!!!!!
patchr aborted during phase 4 (calculating results).
I STRONGLY recommend deleting data/incremental/2023-12-14_14-04/ after exploring this error.
Then delete the folder data/updates/2023-12-14_14-04/, fix the error(s), and run patchr again. 
!!!!!!!!
