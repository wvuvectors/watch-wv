Ok, I'm about to start modifying the watchdb files in data/latest/.
First, let's back up data/latest/ to data/latest_bk/.
Now I'll create a new watchdb folder in data/incremental/2023-12-14_21-39/.
It will hold the latest watchdb after update with data from data/updates/2023-12-14_21-39/.
Now I'm merging the watchdb tables from data/latest/ with the update tables in data/updates/2023-12-14_21-39/.
These merged tables will be put in the folder that I just created, data/incremental/2023-12-14_21-39/.
******
Running 4_appendUpdate.pl data/incremental/2023-12-14_21-39 data/updates/2023-12-14_21-39/.

Now I will generate the RESULT table using the updated watchdb tables in data/incremental/2023-12-14_21-39.

INFO : There is no previous result table in data/incremental/2023-12-14_21-39. INFO : That's not fatal, because I generate a complete result file anyway.
INFO : However, it means I may be changing any previous validated results.
INFO : Just so you know.
No extraction with id L01-0536.e1 in the assay L01-0536.a2.
$VAR1 = {

5_calculateResults.pl exited with error code 255 and caused patchr to abort.
!!!!!!!!
patchr aborted during phase 5 (calculating results).
I STRONGLY recommend deleting data/incremental/2023-12-14_21-39/ after exploring this error.
Then delete the folder data/updates/2023-12-14_21-39/, fix the error(s), and run patchr again. 
!!!!!!!!
