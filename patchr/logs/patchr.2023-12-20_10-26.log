Ok, I'm about to start modifying the watchdb files in data/latest/.
First, let's back up data/latest/ to data/latest_bk/.
Now I'll create a new watchdb folder in data/incremental/2023-12-20_10-26/.
It will hold the latest watchdb after update with data from data/updates/2023-12-20_10-26/.
Now I'm merging the watchdb tables from data/latest/ with the update tables in data/updates/2023-12-20_10-26/.
These merged tables will be put in the folder that I just created, data/incremental/2023-12-20_10-26/.
******
Running 4_appendUpdate.pl data/incremental/2023-12-20_10-26 data/updates/2023-12-20_10-26/.
******

Now I will generate the RESULT table using the updated watchdb tables in data/incremental/2023-12-20_10-26.
******
Running 5_calculateResults.pl data/incremental/2023-12-20_10-26.
******
INFO : There is no previous result table in data/incremental/2023-12-20_10-26.
INFO : That's not fatal, because I generate a complete result file anyway.
INFO : However, it means I may be changing any previous validated results.
INFO : Just so you know.

******
Running 6_generateBatchList.pl data/incremental/2023-12-20_10-26 > watchdb.completed_batches.txt.
******

******
Everything appears to be ok, so on to the final step.
I am now copying the watchdb tables from data/incremental/2023-12-20_10-26/ to data/latest/, overwriting the old set.
Never fear! The previous version is still readily available in data/latest_bk/, and older sets in the data/incremental/ folder.
******
Updating the README file.
The most recent version of the watchdb can be found in two places:
    data/incremental/2023-12-20_10-26/
    and
    data/latest/
data/latest_bk/ contains the data from immediately before this update was applied.
