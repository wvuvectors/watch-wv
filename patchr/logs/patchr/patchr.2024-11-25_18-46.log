Ok, I'm about to start modifying the watchdb files in /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/latest/.
First, let's back up /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/latest/ to /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/latest_bk/.

Now I'll create a new watchdb folder in /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/incremental/2024-11-25_18-46/.
It will hold the latest watchdb after update with data from /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/updates/2024-11-25_18-46/.


Now I'm merging the watchdb tables from /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/latest/ with the update tables in /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/updates/2024-11-25_18-46/.
These merged tables will be put in the folder that I just created, /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/incremental/2024-11-25_18-46/.

Now I will generate the RESULT table using the updated watchdb tables in /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/incremental/2024-11-25_18-46.

Undefined sample with id pc in sample table

5_calculateResults.pl exited with error code 255 and caused patchr to abort.
!!!!!!!!
patchr aborted during phase 5 (calculating results).
Check the file /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/incremental/2024-11-25_18-46/_result.rejections.txt for details.
I STRONGLY recommend deleting /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/incremental/2024-11-25_18-46/ after exploring this error.
Then delete the folder /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/updates/2024-11-25_18-46/, fix the error(s), and run patchr again. 
!!!!!!!!
