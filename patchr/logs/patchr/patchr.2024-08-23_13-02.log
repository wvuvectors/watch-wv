3_validateUpdate.pl exited with error code 1 and caused patchr to abort.
Most likely this script identifed duplicate IDs or collisions (IDs present in both the existing db and the update). Check the following files for more info:

patchr aborted during phase 3 (update validation).
Delete the folder /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/updates/2024-08-23_13-02/. 
Then fix the error(s) and run patchr again.
