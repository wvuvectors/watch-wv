Resolving 590 collisons between update and watchdb...


Ok, I'm about to start modifying the watchdb files in /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/latest/.
First, let's back up /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/latest/ to /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/latest_bk/.

Now I'll create a new watchdb folder in /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/incremental/2025-07-01_13-53/.
It will hold the latest watchdb after update with data from /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/updates/2025-07-01_13-53/.


Now I'm merging the watchdb tables from /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/latest/ with the update tables in /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/updates/2025-07-01_13-53/.
These merged tables will be put in the folder that I just created, /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/incremental/2025-07-01_13-53/.

Now I will generate the RESULT table using the updated watchdb tables in /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/incremental/2025-07-01_13-53.

Running 5_calculateResults.pl /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/incremental/2025-07-01_13-53.

Running 6_generateBatchList.pl /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/incremental/2025-07-01_13-53 > /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/incremental/2025-07-01_13-53/watchdb.completed_batches.txt.

******
Everything appears to be ok, so on to the final step.
I am now copying the watchdb tables from /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/incremental/2025-07-01_13-53/ to /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/latest/, overwriting the old set.
Never fear! The previous version is still readily available in /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/latest_bk/, and older sets in the /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/incremental/ folder.
******

Updating the README file.

File copy finished.
The most recent version of the watchdb can be found in two places:
    /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/incremental/2025-07-01_13-53/
    and
    /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/latest/
/Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/latest_bk/ contains the data from immediately before this update was applied.

All done! patchr run of 2025-07-01_13-53 will now exit.
