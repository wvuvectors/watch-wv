Ok, I'm about to start modifying the watchdb files in data/latest/.
First, let's back up data/latest/ to data/latest_bk/.

Now I'll create a new watchdb folder in data/incremental/2024-04-10_12-55/.
It will hold the latest watchdb after update with data from data/updates/2024-04-10_12-55/.


Now I'm merging the watchdb tables from data/latest/ with the update tables in data/updates/2024-04-10_12-55/.
These merged tables will be put in the folder that I just created, data/incremental/2024-04-10_12-55/.

******
Running 4_appendUpdate.pl data/incremental/2024-04-10_12-55 data/updates/2024-04-10_12-55/.
******



Now I will generate the RESULT table using the updated watchdb tables in data/incremental/2024-04-10_12-55.

Running 5_calculateResults.pl data/incremental/2024-04-10_12-55.

******



******
Everything appears to be ok, so on to the final step.
I am now copying the watchdb tables from data/incremental/2024-04-10_12-55/ to data/latest/, overwriting the old set.
Never fear! The previous version is still readily available in data/latest_bk/, and older sets in the data/incremental/ folder.
******

Updating the README file.

File copy finished.
The most recent version of the watchdb can be found in two places:
    data/incremental/2024-04-10_12-55/
    and
    data/latest/
data/latest_bk/ contains the data from immediately before this update was applied.

All done! patchr run of 2024-04-10_12-55 will now exit.
