Ok, I'm about to start modifying the watchdb files in /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/latest/.
First, let's back up /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/latest/ to /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/latest_bk/.

Now I'll create a new watchdb folder in /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/incremental/2026-01-18_15-09/.
It will hold the latest watchdb after update with data from /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/updates/2026-01-18_15-09/.


Now I'm merging the watchdb tables from /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/latest/ with the update tables in /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/updates/2026-01-18_15-09/.
These merged tables will be put in the folder that I just created, /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/incremental/2026-01-18_15-09/.

INFO : concentration id A02-1295.c1 already exists in either the update or the main watchdb (before update).
INFO : A02-1295.c1 will not be added again!
INFO : It is unclear how this passed the validation stage, so you may want to look into it.
INFO : extraction id A02-1295.e1 already exists in either the update or the main watchdb (before update).
INFO : A02-1295.e1 will not be added again!
INFO : It is unclear how this passed the validation stage, so you may want to look into it.



Now I will generate the RESULT table using the updated watchdb tables in /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/incremental/2026-01-18_15-09.

******
Everything appears to be ok, so on to the final step.
I am now copying the watchdb tables from /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/incremental/2026-01-18_15-09/ to /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/latest/, overwriting the old set.
Never fear! The previous version is still readily available in /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/latest_bk/, and older sets in the /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/incremental/ folder.
******

Updating the README file.

File copy finished.
The most recent version of the watchdb can be found in two places:
    /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/incremental/2026-01-18_15-09/
    and
    /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/latest/
/Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/latest_bk/ contains the data from immediately before this update was applied.

All done! patchr run of 2026-01-18_15-09 will now exit.
