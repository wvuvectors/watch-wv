Resolving 172 collisons between update and watchdb...


Ok, I'm about to start modifying the watchdb files in /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/latest/.
First, let's back up /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/latest/ to /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/latest_bk/.

Now I'll create a new watchdb folder in /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/incremental/2024-08-23_14-13/.
It will hold the latest watchdb after update with data from /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/updates/2024-08-23_14-13/.


Now I'm merging the watchdb tables from /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/latest/ with the update tables in /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/updates/2024-08-23_14-13/.
These merged tables will be put in the folder that I just created, /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/incremental/2024-08-23_14-13/.

Now I will generate the RESULT table using the updated watchdb tables in /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/incremental/2024-08-23_14-13.

******
Running 5_calculateResults.pl /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/incremental/2024-08-23_14-13.

5_calculateResults.pl exited with error code 5 and caused patchr to abort.
!!!!!!!!
patchr aborted during phase 5 (calculating results).
Check the file /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/incremental/2024-08-23_14-13/_result.rejections.txt for details.
I STRONGLY recommend deleting /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/incremental/2024-08-23_14-13/ after exploring this error.
Then delete the folder /Users/tpd0001/github/watch-wv/patchr/data/updates/2024-08-23_14-13/, fix the error(s), and run patchr again. 
!!!!!!!!
