Resolving 62 collisons between update and watchdb...

3_validateUpdate.pl exited with error code 62 and caused patchr to abort.
Most likely this script identifed duplicate IDs or collisions (IDs present in both the existing db and the update). Check the following files for more info:
    data/updates/2024-03-12_16-25//_collisions.txt
    data/updates/2024-03-12_16-25//_rundups.txt
    data/updates/2024-03-12_16-25//_watchdups.txt
!!!!!!!!
patchr aborted during phase 3 (update validation).
Delete the folder data/updates/2024-03-12_16-25/. 
Then fix the error(s) and run patchr again.
