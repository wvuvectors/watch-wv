Ok, I'm about to start modifying the watchdb files in data/latest/.
First, let's back up data/latest/ to data/latest_bk/.

Now I'll create a new watchdb folder in data/incremental/2024-04-09_16-48/.
It will hold the latest watchdb after update with data from data/updates/2024-04-09_16-48/.


Now I'm merging the watchdb tables from data/latest/ with the update tables in data/updates/2024-04-09_16-48/.
These merged tables will be put in the folder that I just created, data/incremental/2024-04-09_16-48/.

Running 4_appendUpdate.pl data/incremental/2024-04-09_16-48 data/updates/2024-04-09_16-48/.

Now I will generate the RESULT table using the updated watchdb tables in data/incremental/2024-04-09_16-48.

Undefined sample with id U01-0072 in sample table

5_calculateResults.pl exited with error code 255 and caused patchr to abort.
!!!!!!!!
patchr aborted during phase 5 (calculating results).
Check the file data/incremental/2024-04-09_16-48/_result.rejections.txt for details.
I STRONGLY recommend deleting data/incremental/2024-04-09_16-48/ after exploring this error.
Then delete the folder data/updates/2024-04-09_16-48/, fix the error(s), and run patchr again. 
!!!!!!!!
