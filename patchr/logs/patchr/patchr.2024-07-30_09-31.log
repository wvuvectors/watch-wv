Resolving 96 collisons between update and watchdb...


Ok, I'm about to start modifying the watchdb files in data/latest/.
First, let's back up data/latest/ to data/latest_bk/.

Now I'll create a new watchdb folder in data/incremental/2024-07-30_09-31/.
It will hold the latest watchdb after update with data from data/updates/2024-07-30_09-31/.


Now I'm merging the watchdb tables from data/latest/ with the update tables in data/updates/2024-07-30_09-31/.
These merged tables will be put in the folder that I just created, data/incremental/2024-07-30_09-31/.

!!!!!!!!
patchr aborted during phase 5 (calculating results).
Check the file data/incremental/2024-07-30_09-31/_result.rejections.txt for details.
I STRONGLY recommend deleting data/incremental/2024-07-30_09-31/ after exploring this error.
Then delete the folder data/updates/2024-07-30_09-31/, fix the error(s), and run patchr again.
