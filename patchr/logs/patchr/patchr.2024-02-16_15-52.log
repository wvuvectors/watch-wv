Ok, I'm about to start modifying the watchdb files in data/latest/.
First, let's back up data/latest/ to data/latest_bk/.

Now I'll create a new watchdb folder in data/incremental/2024-02-16_15-52/.
It will hold the latest watchdb after update with data from data/updates/2024-02-16_15-52/.


Now I'm merging the watchdb tables from data/latest/ with the update tables in data/updates/2024-02-16_15-52/.
These merged tables will be put in the folder that I just created, data/incremental/2024-02-16_15-52/.

Running 4_appendUpdate.pl data/incremental/2024-02-16_15-52 data/updates/2024-02-16_15-52/.

Now I will generate the RESULT table using the updated watchdb tables in data/incremental/2024-02-16_15-52.

5_calculateResults.pl exited with error code 2 and caused patchr to abort.
!!!!!!!!
patchr aborted during phase 5 (calculating results).
Check the file data/incremental/2024-02-16_15-52/_result.rejections.txt for details.
I STRONGLY recommend deleting data/incremental/2024-02-16_15-52/ after exploring this error.
Then delete the folder data/updates/2024-02-16_15-52/, fix the error(s), and run patchr again. 
!!!!!!!!
